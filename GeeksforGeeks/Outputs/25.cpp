/*Key point in the above snippet is de-referencing of void pointer.
 It should be noted that de-referencing of void pointer isnâ€™t allowed because void is an incomplete data type.
  The correct way to assign value of 5 would be first to typecast void pointer and then use it.
 So instead of *ptr, one should use *(int *)ptr.
